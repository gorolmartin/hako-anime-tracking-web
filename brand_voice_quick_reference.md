# BRAND VOICE GUARDIAN: QUICK REFERENCE

## TL;DR - The Brand Voice in 5 Bullets
1. **Friendly**: Talk like texting your anime friend, not a corporate email
2. **Reference-Rich**: Weave in anime references naturally (but don't force it)
3. **Occasionally Funny**: Humor about shared fan experiences, never mean-spirited
4. **Clear First**: Personality enhances, never confuses
5. **Inclusive**: All anime fans welcome, no gatekeeping

---

## INSTANT VOICE CHECK

Does your copy pass the vibe check?

âœ… **YES if it sounds like**: Your anime-loving friend explaining something helpful
âŒ **NO if it sounds like**: A marketing robot discovered anime yesterday

---

## THE GOLDEN RULES

### ðŸŽ¯ Rule #1: Clarity > Cleverness
Don't sacrifice understanding for a reference

**Good**: "Sort your shows by genre, mood, or rating"
**Bad**: "Use our Divine Moonlight Greatsword of filtering" (what does this even do?)

### ðŸŽ­ Rule #2: References Must Land
Use anime everyone knows OR provide context

**Good**: "Your list is longer than a One Piece marathon"
**Bad**: "This reminds me of episode 47 of Gintama when..." (too specific)

### ðŸ˜… Rule #3: Humor Should Be Relatable
Make fun of shared experiences, not individuals

**Good**: "We've all accidentally watched an entire season in one night"
**Bad**: "People who don't watch subs are missing out" (gatekeeping)

### ðŸ’¬ Rule #4: Tone Matches Platform
Social = Playful | App = Helpful | Errors = Apologetic

## EXAMPLE PROMPTS FOR THE GUARDIAN

### Review Existing Copy
```
Review this social media caption for brand voice:

"Check out our new app feature! You can now track your anime progress with ease using our advanced algorithms and seamless UI/UX integration."

Make it match our friendly, anime-reference-rich brand voice.
```

### Create New Content
```
Write 3 Twitter posts announcing our new "Mood-Based Recommendations" feature. 

Make them:
- Friendly and excited
- Include 1-2 anime references each
- Show how the feature solves a real problem
- Different angles for each post
```

```
Turn this corporate feature description into our brand voice:

"The synchronization feature enables users to maintain consistent data across multiple devices through our cloud-based infrastructure."

Make it sound like I'm explaining it to a friend.
```

### Write Platform-Specific Variations
```
I need this message in our brand voice for different platforms:

Core message: "We just hit 10,000 users!"

Create versions for:
1. Twitter (celebratory thread)
2. Instagram (caption for celebratory graphic)
3. App push notification
4. Email to existing users
```

### Check Tone Consistency
```
Do these three app button labels match our brand voice?

1. "Initiate Viewing Session"
2. "Begin Your Adventure"
3. "Start Watching"

Rank them by brand fit and explain why.
```

### Add Anime References
```
Make this more anime-reference rich without losing clarity:

"You've watched a lot of action shows. Want to try something different?"

Add 1-2 references that feel natural.
```

### Remove Excessive References
```
This copy has too many references. Clean it up while keeping personality:

"Notice me, senpai! We've gone full PLUS ULTRA on this update! It's more SUGOI than finding a fellow Evangelion fan at a party. Your waifu would approve, believe it! Time to go Super Saiyan on your watch list, dattebayo!"

Make it actually usable.
```

### Create Empty State Copy
```
Write copy for when user's "Currently Watching" list is empty.

Should be:
- Encouraging, not judgmental
- Include light humor
- Clear CTA
- Under 25 words
```

### Write Achievement Messages
```
User just completed their 100th anime. Write a congratulations message that's:
- Celebratory but not over-the-top
- Includes anime reference
- Encourages them to keep going
- Under 30 words
```

### Review for Gatekeeping
```
Does this copy gatekeep or alienate any fans?

"Real anime fans know that dubs are inferior to the original Japanese audio. We support true otaku culture!"

If yes, rewrite it to be inclusive.
```

### Sounds too formal?
â†’ Add contractions (we're, you'll, it's)
â†’ Use "you" instead of "users"
â†’ Ask a question
â†’ Add one emoji

### Sounds too try-hard?
â†’ Remove half the emojis
â†’ Cut excessive references
â†’ Simplify the language
â†’ Read it out loud (cringe test)

### Sounds too boring?
â†’ Add personality to the verb ("check out" not "view")
â†’ Include relatable situation
â†’ Add one anime reference
â†’ Make it conversational

### Unclear what it means?
â†’ Clarity first! Strip back to core message
â†’ Then add personality second
â†’ Test: Would your mom understand it?

Read your copy out loud. Then ask:

1. **Would I text this to a friend?** (Yes = good)

3. **Will anime fans get it?** (No = revise)
4. **Is the main point clear?** (No = simplify)

If you get 4+ "good" answers, you're on brand! âœ¨
